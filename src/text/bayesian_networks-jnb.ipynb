    "While the above is a correct encoding of the given Bayesian network, it is perhaps not very intuitive due to the auxiliary atoms. Fortunately, ProbLog2 offers some syntactic sugar called **probabilistic clauses** to encode this in a more readable way. Above, we encoded the information that the conditional probability of an *alarm* given a *burglary* and an *earthquake* equals 0.9 using the rule `alarm :- burglary, earthquake, p_alarm1`, plus the probabilistic fact `0.9::p_alarm1`. We can replace both with a single probabilistic clause of the form `0.9::alarm :- burglary, earthquake`. This should be read as: if *burglary* and *earthquake* are true, this causes *alarm* to become true with probability 0.9 if there is a *burglary* and an *earthquake*. As this example illustrates, a probabilistic clause has a body, just like regular ProbLog rules, and a head. The difference is that now, the head is annotated with a probability. By also using probabilistic clauses for the other rules in the ProbLog encoding of the Bayesian network, we get the following program."

We can extend the Bayesian network to have a multi-valued variable by indicating the severity of the *earthquake*. The literal `earthquake` now has three possible values `none`, `mild`, `heavy` instead of previously two (no or yes). The probabilities of each value is denoted by the **annotated disjunction** in `0.01::earthquake(heavy); 0.19::earthquake(mild); 0.8::earthquake(none)`. An annotated disjunction is similar to a probabilistic disjunction, but with a different head. Instead of it being one atom annotated with a probability, it is now a disjunction of atoms each annotated with a probability."
