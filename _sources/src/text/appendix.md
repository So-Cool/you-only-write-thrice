## Accessibility Statement ##

The main output format of the proposed Jupyter Book publishing workflow
are HTML pages, and the ubiquity of web technologies ensures
availability of compatible accessibility tools. In particular, adherence
to web accessibility standards and utilisation of commonplace assistive
technology can render the artefacts of our workflow widely approachable.
For example, tools such as navigation aids; screen readers; screen
magnifiers; page display colour, contrast and brightness adjustments; as
well as font (size and colour) customisation can be easily deployed.
Additionally, accessibility of computational notebooks is constantly
monitored and improved by the Project Jupyter's Accessibility Working
Group[^_12]. Similarly, the reveal.js platform allows inclusion of custom
plugins, with availability of community-developed accessibility
improvements[^_13].

Since the generated web resources are *static* (from the technology
perspective), they can be downloaded onto a personal computer and
browsed offline. The use of modern web technologies makes them
*responsive*, thus compatible with computers and mobile devices of
varying screen size. In addition to the HTML output, the proposed
workflow can build other popular formats such as PDF or EPUB, which are
suitable for tablets and e-readers. We envisage hosting the content
source files at popular code sharing and versioning platforms -- such as
GitHub or Bitbucket -- that support rich ticketing and issue management
systems. In particular, the readers can use these mechanisms to provide
feedback and raise accessibility concerns.
